—In the modern diagnosis of diseases using 
diagnostic imaging techniques, manual visual examination by 
trained professionals is still the gold standard (though this 
method is subjective, has a high level of variability between 
operators, and is very time-consuming). This report discusses a 
complete, integrated AI solution that utilizes deep learning 
image analytics along with LLM based medical interpretation to 
increase the accuracy of screening/diagnosing a large number of 
diseases in an accelerated fashion. The proposed AI solution will 
help provide early detection capabilities for several different 
clinical diseases (Alzheimer's Disease to several types of cancer 
including lung, breast, kidney, colon, cervix, and mouth cancers, 
leukemia, etc.), as well as some neurological disorders. 
Deep CNN models learn from the medical imaging datasets 
to identify the most significant visual features associated with a 
particular disease. Over 130,000 medical images were used to 
train the CNN model, with annotations associated with 30 
clinically significant diseases. In addition to using a CNN model 
to classify the images, this work utilizes a Transformer-based 
LLM that can summarize the diagnostic result, verbally 
translate the probability scores into an interpretable narrative 
format for use by clinicians, and also provide context for the 
overall score. The experimental validation of the proposed 
solution indicates very strong generalizability; the average 
validation accuracy is 94.82% and the average validation loss is 
less than 0.012. The individual accuracy and loss metrics for each 
class of disease indicate an extremely reliable and stable 
classifier across all types of disease. The solution has been 
validated against multiple imaging modalities (MRI, CT and 
Histo Pathology slides).. Overall, this unified solution aims to support clinicians by 
improving diagnostic efficiency, reducing interpretation delays, 
and strengthening early disease intervention through intelligent 
image-language fusion.
